<div class="school-section">
    <h1>Welcome to the School Section</h1>
    <p>This section is designed to help you navigate all the school-related materials effectively. Use the sidebar to explore notes, find resources, and locate assignments.</p>

    <h2>How to Use the Sidebar</h2>
    <p>
        The sidebar is organized by class. Each class contains directories for the notes taken during that course. Click on a class to expand it, and then click on a note to view it. If you’re unsure where to start, the class names will guide you.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can collapse and expand directories by clicking on the folder names. This makes it easy to find exactly what you’re looking for.
    </p>

    <h2>Using the Search Bar</h2>
    <p>
        In the top-right corner, you'll find the search bar. Use this to quickly locate notes or topics. Simply type in a keyword or phrase, and the search will return relevant results. This is the fastest way to find specific information within the notes.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Search by topic (e.g., "Calculus Derivatives").</li>
        <li>Search by class (e.g., "Physics 101").</li>
    </ul>
